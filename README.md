# Weather App

A weather app built using Node JS on the backend with ExpressJS and OpenWeather API to get weather forecast for any location.

Handlebars is used for building the user interface.

The app makes use of MapBox GeoCoding features to search for location. The location coordinates are then supplied to the OpenWeather API to get the weather forecast for the location.

MapBox is a great tool and I enjoy using it.

## Is it breathing?

Yes. Sure, it is. The app has been deployed on Heroku. It is accessible [*here*](https://waheedcodes-weather-app.herokuapp.com/).

### What's your plan with this project?

Though it's meant to show my abilities to make use of NodeJS, Express and how to connect with an API while crafting out mine from an external one.

It's going to be improved upon overtime and made available for users...so help me God!
